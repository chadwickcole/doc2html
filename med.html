<h2>Terms to Know</h2>
<p><strong>Copay:</strong>(All plans)<strong></strong>A set dollar amount you pay for some healthcare expenses, such as
    doctor’s office and urgent care visits.</p>
<p><strong>Coinsurance:</strong>(Aetna PPO)<strong></strong>The percentage you pay for a service after Aetna kicks in
    its coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Deductible:</strong>(Aetna PPO only) The amount you pay each year before the plan covers anything for
    services that don’t require a copay. You don’t have to meet the deductible before the plan pays for preventive care
    and some other services, such as those that require a copay.</p>
<p><strong>Out-of-pocket maximum:</strong> (All plans) This is the most you ever have to pay for medical services during
    the year. If you hit this maximum, the plan will cover your in-network care at 100% for the rest of the plan
    year.</p>
<p><strong>Reasonable and customary (R&amp;C) charges:</strong> (Aetna PPO only) The amount Aetna usually charges for a
    medical service in a specific place. When you use network providers, you don’t have to worry about R&amp;C charges.
    When you use out-of-network providers in the Aetna PPO, R&amp;C charges are used to determine how much the Aetna PPO
    will cover.</p>
<p>[end callout]</p>
<h2>How the Plans Are Alike</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Free Preventive Care:</strong>All plans cover eligible preventive care, such as well-woman exams and
    well-child visits, at 100% when you use an in-network provider.</li><li><strong>Out-of-Pocket Maximum:</strong>Each
    plan has an annual in-network out-of-pocket maximum of $1,500 for individuals and $3,000 for families.</li></ul>
<h2>How the Plans Are Different</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Deductible:</strong> Only the Aetna PPO has a deductible.</li><li><strong>Provider Network:</strong>
    Each plan has a different network of doctors and providers.</li><li><strong>Out-of-Network Coverage:</strong> Only
    the Aetna PPO provides out-of-network coverage (unless it’s emergency care—all the plans cover
    emergencies).</li></ul>
<p>California</p>
<ul><li><strong>Prescriptions:</strong> With the Aetna PPO or EPO, preventive medicines are covered in full. With the
    Kaiser plan, you’ll pay a small copay. In all plans, you’ll pay a small copay for all other types of
    medicine.</li></ul>

<h2>Costs</h2>
<p>

  The chart below shows your cost per pay period for each plan. These costs are deducted from your paychecks before
      taxes. That means you pay less in federal taxes (and in some cases, state taxes).

<h2>1095 Tax Forms</h2>
<p>The Affordable Care Act requires that employers and health insurers provide 1095 tax forms to all full-time
    employees. We’ll mail it by March 2. You don’t need this form to complete your tax filing, since you just need to
    check a box when you file to confirm you had health coverage. But this form will serve as proof that you had
    coverage, so you should keep it with your tax documentation for the year. If you had multiple employers during the
    year, you’ll receive multiple forms.</p>
<p>Make sure your address is accurate in Workday [link to Workday] by December 31 to ensure you’ll receive your
    form.</p>
<p>US, except California</p>
<p>There are three types of 1095 forms. The plan you enroll in will impact which form (or forms) you’ll receive.</p>
<ul><li><strong>1095-A:</strong> If you purchased an individual marketplace plan from the Health Insurance Marketplace,
    you’ll receive this form from your provider. It won’t come from Facebook.</li><li><strong>1095-B:</strong> This form
    reports the type of coverage you have, your covered dependents and the period of coverage. You’ll receive it if
    you’re an expat and you have Geo-Blue health coverage.</li><li><strong>1095-C:</strong> This form reports that you
    were offered coverage by Facebook. Sometimes this will also indicate the type of coverage you have, your covered
    dependents and the period of coverage. You’ll receive this form from Facebook no matter what your medical plan
    enrollment decision is.</li></ul>
